<blockquote>
<p>This two part series examines the extent to which global trends in disaffection towards political institutions also manifest themselves in Cyprus and how it compares to other EU countries. Trust towards political parties is examined in this first part of the series. The analysis finds that trust in parties has been declining over the past 15 years, particularly from 2014 onwards. In contrast, the EU as a whole experienced relative stability during this period. Turkish-Cypriots tend to be 2-3 times more trusting of political parties than Greek-Cypriots and slightly more likely to be members of one. The second part of the series will examine trust towards EU institutions.

Αυτή η σειρά αποτελείται από δύο μέρη και εξετάζει το βαθμό στον οποίο οι παγκόσμιες τάσεις γύρω από την δυσαρέσκεια απέναντι στους πολιτικούς θεσμούς εκδηλώνονται και στην Κύπρο και πώς συγκρίνεται με άλλες χώρες της ΕΕ. Η εμπιστοσύνη προς τα πολιτικά κόμματα εξετάζεται σε αυτό το πρώτο μέρος της σειράς. Η ανάλυση διαπιστώνει ότι η εμπιστοσύνη προς κόμματα μειώνεται τα τελευταία 15 χρόνια, ιδιαίτερα από το 2014 και μετά. Αντιθέτως, η ΕΕ ως σύνολο αντιμετωπίσε σχετική σταθερότητα κατά τη διάρκεια αυτής της περιόδου. Οι Τουρκοκύπριοι τείνουν να είναι 2-3 φορές πιο εμπιστευτικοί των πολιτικών κομμάτων από τους Ελληνοκύπριους και λίγο πιο πιθανό να είναι μέλη ενός κόμματος. Το δεύτερο μέρος θα εξετάσει την εμπιστοσύνη προς τους θεσμούς της ΕΕ.

Bu iki bolümlük seride global politik güven trendleri Kıbrıs’ta ve diğer Avrupa ülkeleri bağlamında ele alınmaktadır. İlk bölümde, politik partilere olan güven incelenmektedir. Ikinci bölümde, hükümet ve parlemantolara olan güven ele alınacaktır. Analizlere göre, Kıbrıs’ta politik güven son 15 yıldır azalmaktadır,özellikle 2004’ten beri. Buna karşın, aynı süre içerisinde Avrupa genelinin ortalamasında güven indeksinde bir azalma veya artma olmamıştır. Politik partilere Kıbrıslı Turkler, Kıbrıslı Rumlara gore 2-3 kat daha fazla güvenmektedir; ve aynı zamanda bir partiye üye olma olasılıkları Kıbrıslı Rumlara gore biraz daha yüksektir. Ikinci bölümde, Avrupa Birliği Kurumlarına olan güven ele alınacaktır.</p>

Political disaffection is a group of phenomena concerning unfavourable attitudes and behaviours towards political processes and institutions, namely parties and politicians, with consequences for people’s involvement in political life, such as political participation and voting. When the public turns away from the institutions and processes we have developed to organise society, then solving common issues and providing public goods becomes more difficult. Trust in parties is one such manifestation of political disaffection that has problematic implications, as parties have traditionally been the ways in which political participation is organized. Grassroots organizing is used by political parties to encourage us to vote, tell us who to vote for, and which policies to support.<br />
<br>
Beginning in the 1960’s and 1970’s trust in politics and government began declining in most countries where long-term data is available. Declining trust in political parties is now prevalent in European democracies (Dalton, 2016; Norris, 2011), as are reductions in official party membership. From around 1980 to 2008, party membership declined in twenty European democracies both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the electorate (van Biezen, Mair, &amp; Poguntke, 2012). In the US, for over four decades the American public has been drifting away from the two major political parties and today a large portion perceives them with almost complete disinterest (Dalton, 2016).<br />
<br>
How do these global trends manifest themselves in Cyprus? To examine Cypriots’ disaffection with political parties the analysis uses data from the Eurobarometer and World Values Survey / European Values Study, international research projects that regularly conduct representative surveys in Cyprus among both Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots.<br />
<br>
Trust in political parties among Cypriots has declined since 2004. During this time it has fallen over 16% from around 25% in 2004 to 9% in 2017. The trends for Turkish-Cypriots and Greek-Cypriots have taken different paths though and Turkish-Cypriots tend to be more trusting of political parties for nearly all years during this time frame. Trust among Greek-Cypriots has eroded at a steeper rate of almost 22%, from around 29% in 2001 to under 8% in 2017. However, the decline in trust among Turkish-Cypriots began in 2014 and until that time it experienced a period of trendless fluctuation, after which it fell markedly for three consecutive years.</p>

<p>Exploring generational differences in trust in parties reveals that today the differences across age are small and analogous for both communities. However, for Greek-Cypriots, even though trust has fallen for all age groups since 2001, the largest declines were for older persons. In particular those age 55 and older who were typically the most trusting of political parties. Where differences between younger and older persons were around 20% during the 2000s, by 2017 they fell to within 5%. Conversely, generational differences were less pronounced for Turkish-Cypriots over this time period. Again, trust was typically higher for older persons.

How does this trend of declining trust in Cyprus compare to the rest of the EU? The levels of trust among citizens of the EU-15 and EU-25 are quite similar, with EU-15 being slightly more trusting than EU-25. The levels of trust in parties throughout the EU were quite stable over this period, unlike the declining trend evident in Cyprus. While at times the levels of trust were similar, in Cyprus it started dipping below the overall EU levels from 2011 onwards. By 2017 it was 12% lower than the EU-25 and 16% lower than the EU-15.</p>

<p>Turning to a behavioral indicator of engagement with political parties, party membership in Cyprus is at around 7-8% and stable between 2006 and 2011. Similar to trust, membership in parties is slightly higher among Turkish-Cypriots, on average around 3% higher.

<p>Political parties in Cyprus have clearly let people down, as Cypriots are considerably less trusting of political parties than the average European. Moreover, given that younger Cypriots are typically the least trusting of parties signifies troubling long-term implications for political processes. The difference between age groups in recent times may be small, and smaller than in the past, but nonetheless, for young people the beginning of their political life is synonymous with distrust.
<br></p>
<p>While Turkish-Cypriots may be less trusting of political parties than the average European, they are still significantly more trusting of them and more likely to be members of one than Greek-Cypriots. The extremely low trust among Greek-Cypriots indicates the severity of parties’ failure to meaningfully engage with them. These failings can be seen from the parties’ dismal abilities in grassroots organizing during recent elections. Turnout at the Republic of Cyprus presidential elections of 2018 and the 2016 parliamentary elections was the lowest ever recorded, at 72% and 67% respectively. Disengagement is again considerably pronounced for the youth as a mere 25% of newly eligible voters (i.e. eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds) actually registered to vote in the 2018 Republic of Cyprus presidential elections (Phileleftheros, 2017). These findings clearly challenge the traditional way of thinking about political parties as meaningful means of connecting the public to their institutions in Cyprus.
