      <description>How important is religion in Cypriots’ lives in light of global trends in religiosity?
• Religious values are prevalent in Cyprus and entrenched in people’s identity, regardless of whether one practices or considers themselves to be religious.
• Nearly all Cypriots consider themselves to be part of a religion or religious denomination, irrespective of whether they attend religious services.
• Overall, Greek-Cypriots tend to be slightly more religious than Turkish-Cypriots.</description>
