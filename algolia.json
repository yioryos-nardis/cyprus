The analysis finds that trust in the EU and its institutions (European Parliament, European Commission, European Central Bank) fell among Cypriots from 2011 onward. However, this is mostly due to lower trust among Greek-Cypriots, as trust is higher and remained more stable for Turkish-Cypriots during this period.","tags":["politics"],"title":"How Disaffected are Cypriots with Political Institutions?: European Union Institutions","type":"post","url":"/post/disaffection-with-eu-institutions/","weight":0,"wordcount":961},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1574035200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":0,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1574035200,"objectID":"","permalink":"/post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"post","url":"/post/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1574035200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":0,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomyTerm","lang":"en","lastmod":1574035200,"objectID":"","permalink":"/tags/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","type":"tags","url":"/tags/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1574035200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":0,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1574035200,"objectID":"","permalink":"/tags/politics/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/politics/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"politics","type":"tags","url":"/tags/politics/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566864000,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"","excerpt_text":"","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1300,"html":"","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"d8c3435771f7f32578619d063256ff85","permalink":"/post/disaffection-with-parties/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","readingtime":6,"relpermalink":"/post/disaffection-with-parties/","section":"post","summary":"This two part series examines the extent to which global trends in disaffection towards political institutions also manifest themselves in Cyprus and how it compares to other EU countries.
